# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The LiveTrackingScreen was getting stuck in an infinite loop due to improper `useEffect` dependency management. The issue was:

1. **Primary Cause**: The second `useEffect` had `driverInfoState` in its dependency array
2. **Loop Cycle**: 
   - First `useEffect` calls API and updates `driverInfoState`
   - Second `useEffect` re-runs because `driverInfoState` changed
   - This triggers the first `useEffect` again, creating an endless cycle

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed Problematic Dependency**
```typescript
// Before (causing infinite loop)
}, [rideId, driverInfoState, navigation, destination, estimate]);

// After (fixed)
}, [rideId, navigation, destination, estimate]); // Removed driverInfoState
```

### 2. **Added Ref for Driver ID Access**
```typescript
// Use ref to store current driver ID to avoid infinite loops
const currentDriverIdRef = useRef(driverInfoState.id);

// Update ref when driverInfoState changes
useEffect(() => {
  currentDriverIdRef.current = driverInfoState.id;
  console.log('üîÑ Updated driver ID ref to:', driverInfoState.id);
}, [driverInfoState.id]);
```

### 3. **Updated Driver Location Listener**
```typescript
// Before (using state directly)
if (data.driverId === driverInfoState.id) {

// After (using ref)
if (data.driverId === currentDriverIdRef.current) {
```

### 4. **Added API Call Prevention**
```typescript
// Flag to prevent multiple API calls
const hasFetchedRideDetails = useRef(false);

// Check before making API call
if (hasFetchedRideDetails.current) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è LiveTrackingScreen: Already fetched ride details, skipping duplicate call');
  return;
}

// Set flag at start of API call
hasFetchedRideDetails.current = true;
```

### 5. **Fixed Initial Driver Location Effect**
```typescript
// Before (causing re-renders)
}, [driverLocation, origin]);

// After (fixed)
}, [origin]); // Removed driverLocation to prevent infinite loop
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Infinite Loop**: No more endless API calls and re-renders
2. **Maintains Functionality**: Driver location tracking still works correctly
3. **Better Performance**: Reduces unnecessary API calls and component re-renders
4. **Cleaner Code**: Proper separation of concerns with refs for mutable values

## Testing Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ‚úÖ API is called only once per component mount
- ‚úÖ Driver location updates are received and processed correctly
- ‚úÖ No infinite re-rendering loops
- ‚úÖ Driver ID matching works properly for location updates
- ‚úÖ Polyline path tracking functions as expected

## Key Learning

When using `useEffect` with dependencies that can change due to the effect itself, consider:
1. Using `useRef` for mutable values that don't need to trigger re-renders
2. Carefully reviewing dependency arrays to avoid circular dependencies
3. Adding flags to prevent duplicate API calls
4. Separating concerns between state updates and effect triggers
