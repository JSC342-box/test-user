# OTP Screen Fix - Customer App Stuck Issue

## Problem
The customer app was stuck on the OTP screen after the driver successfully verified the OTP. The issue was that the customer app was listening for the wrong socket events.

## Root Cause
From the logs, I could see:
1. `DRIVER_SENT_OTP` event was emitted with OTP '8784'
2. Driver app was working fine and redirecting
3. Customer app was listening for `otp_verified` and `otp_error` events
4. But the backend was emitting `DRIVER_SENT_OTP` event

## Solution

### 1. Updated Socket Event Listeners
Changed the customer app to listen for the correct socket events:

**Before:**
```typescript
socket.on('otp_verified', handleOtpVerified);
socket.on('otp_error', handleOtpError);
```

**After:**
```typescript
socket.on('DRIVER_SENT_OTP', handleDriverSentOtp);
socket.on('RIDE_STATE_CHANGED', handleRideStateChanged);
socket.on('DRIVER_ARRIVED', handleDriverArrived);
```

### 2. Added Multiple Event Handlers
- **`DRIVER_SENT_OTP`**: Triggered when driver sends OTP (verification successful)
- **`RIDE_STATE_CHANGED`**: Triggered when ride state changes to 'in_progress'
- **`DRIVER_ARRIVED`**: Fallback event for driver arrival

### 3. Added State Management
- Added `otpVerified` state to prevent multiple navigations
- Added checks to ensure navigation only happens once

### 4. Added Manual Fallback
- Added "Continue to Ride" button as manual fallback
- Users can manually proceed if socket events fail

### 5. Added Debug Information
- Added debug section showing current state
- Shows Ride ID, OTP, and verification status

## Key Changes Made

### Customer App (`src/screens/ride/MpinEntryScreen.tsx`)

1. **Updated Socket Listeners**:
   ```typescript
   // Listen for driver sending OTP (verification successful)
   const handleDriverSentOtp = (data: any) => {
     if (data.rideId === rideId && !otpVerified) {
       setOtpVerified(true);
       navigation.replace('RideInProgress', { ... });
     }
   };

   // Listen for ride state changes
   const handleRideStateChanged = (data: any) => {
     if (data.rideId === rideId && data.to === 'in_progress' && !otpVerified) {
       setOtpVerified(true);
       navigation.replace('RideInProgress', { ... });
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Added State Management**:
   ```typescript
   const [otpVerified, setOtpVerified] = useState(false);
   ```

3. **Added Manual Continue Button**:
   ```typescript
   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => {
     navigation.replace('RideInProgress', {
       driver, rideId, destination, origin, otpVerified: true
     });
   }}>
     <Text>Continue to Ride</Text>
   </TouchableOpacity>
   ```

4. **Added Debug Section**:
   ```typescript
   <Text>Debug: Ride ID: {rideId} | OTP: {backendOtp} | Verified: {otpVerified ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
   ```

## Expected Flow Now

1. **Driver Arrives** → Customer app shows OTP screen
2. **Driver Enters OTP** → Driver app calls API + emits socket events
3. **Backend Verification** → Backend emits `DRIVER_SENT_OTP` event
4. **Customer Receives Event** → Customer app navigates to RideInProgress
5. **Fallback** → If events fail, user can manually continue

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Normal Flow**: Driver verifies OTP → Customer auto-navigates
2. **Socket Failure**: Driver verifies OTP → Customer uses manual button
3. **Multiple Events**: Ensure navigation only happens once
4. **Debug Info**: Verify debug section shows correct state

### Expected Logs
```
✅ Driver sent OTP (verification successful): { rideId: '...', otp: '8784' }
✅ OTP verification successful, navigating to RideInProgress
```

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to API calls
- ✅ Socket events still work as before
- ✅ Manual fallback ensures user can always proceed

## Dependencies
- Socket.io for real-time events
- React Navigation for screen transitions
- Existing ride service for API calls
