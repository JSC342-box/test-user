# ðŸš€ Push Notification Testing Guide

## âœ… **What's Now Working**

Your push notification system is now fully integrated into your booking flow! Here's what happens:

### **1. Booking Flow with Push Notifications**

#### **Step 1: Confirm Ride Screen**
- When user taps "Book Ride"
- âœ… **Ride Request Notification** is sent to the user's device
- âœ… Notification shows: "New Ride Request from Your current location to [destination]"

#### **Step 2: Finding Driver Screen**
- When a driver accepts the ride
- âœ… **Ride Accepted Notification** is sent to the user's device
- âœ… Notification shows: "Ride Accepted! Your ride has been accepted by [Driver Name]. ETA: [time]"

#### **Step 3: Live Tracking Screen**
- When driver arrives at pickup location
- âœ… **Driver Arrived Notification** is sent to the user's device
- âœ… Notification shows: "Pilot Arrived! [Driver Name] has arrived at your pickup location. Please come outside."

#### **Step 4: Chat Notifications**
- When receiving messages from driver or sending messages
- âœ… **Chat Notification** is sent to the recipient's device
- âœ… Notification shows: "New message from [Sender Name]: [Message]"
- âœ… Supports text, image, and location message types

### **2. How to Test**

#### **A. Test the Complete Booking Flow**

1. **Start your app** and navigate to the booking flow
2. **Enter pickup and destination** locations
3. **Tap "Book Ride"** on the Confirm Ride screen
4. **Check your device** for the ride request notification
5. **Wait for driver acceptance** (or simulate it in your backend)
6. **Check your device** for the ride accepted notification

#### **B. Test Different App States**

**App in Foreground:**
- Notifications appear as banners at the top
- You can tap them to navigate to the appropriate screen

**App in Background:**
- Notifications appear in your device's notification tray
- Tap to wake the app and navigate

**App Closed:**
- Notifications wake the app and navigate to the correct screen

### **3. Manual Testing Commands**

You can still use the manual testing script for individual notifications:

```bash
# Test ride request notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" ride_request

# Test ride accepted notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" ride_accepted

# Test driver arrived notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" ride_arrived

# Test chat notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" chat

# Test payment notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" payment

# Test promotional notification
node scripts/test-push-notifications.js "ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]" promo
```

### **4. What You Should See**

#### **During Booking Flow:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting ride booking process...
âœ… Ride request notification sent
âœ… Push token obtained and stored: ExponentPushToken[M__uE-O_luypvy8AhePC9m]
```

#### **When Driver Accepts:**
```
âœ… Driver accepted ride (callback): {...}
âœ… Ride accepted notification sent
```

#### **When Driver Arrives:**
```
ðŸš— Driver arrived at pickup location
âœ… Driver arrived notification sent
```

#### **On Your Device:**
- **Ride Request**: "New Ride Request from Your current location to [destination]"
- **Ride Accepted**: "Ride Accepted! Your ride has been accepted by [Driver Name]. ETA: [time]"
- **Driver Arrived**: "Pilot Arrived! [Driver Name] has arrived at your pickup location. Please come outside."
- **Chat Message**: "New message from [Sender Name]: [Message]"

### **5. Troubleshooting**

#### **If you don't see notifications:**

1. **Check permissions**: Ensure notifications are enabled in app settings
2. **Check console logs**: Look for push token generation and notification sending
3. **Check device state**: Try with app in background/foreground/closed
4. **Verify token**: Ensure the push token is being generated correctly

#### **Common Issues:**

- **"No push token available"**: Notifications will still work, but no push notifications sent
- **"Error sending notification"**: Check internet connection and Expo service status
- **Notifications not appearing**: Check device notification settings

### **6. Next Steps**

#### **For Production:**

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace the simulated notifications with real backend calls
2. **Driver App**: Implement driver-side notifications for ride requests
3. **Payment Notifications**: Add payment success/failure notifications
4. **Promotional Notifications**: Schedule promotional notifications

#### **Advanced Features:**

1. **Deep Linking**: Test notification taps to ensure proper navigation
2. **Rich Notifications**: Add images and action buttons
3. **Scheduled Notifications**: Send promotional notifications at specific times
4. **Analytics**: Track notification delivery and engagement
