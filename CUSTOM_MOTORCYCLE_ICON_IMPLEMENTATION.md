# Custom Motorcycle Icon Implementation

## Overview
Updated the LiveTrackingScreen to use the custom `iconAnimation1.png` image as the driver marker icon instead of the previous scooter image.

## 🏍️ **Icon Description**
The `iconAnimation1.png` image features:
- **Top-down view** of a person riding a motorcycle
- **Vibrant lime green** motorcycle and rider gear
- **Green glow effect** around the motorcycle suggesting movement
- **Dark grey background** for contrast
- **Minimalist, flat design** suitable for app icons

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated Driver Marker Icon**
```typescript
// Before
<Image 
  source={Images.SCOOTER_1}
  style={{ width: 32, height: 32, tintColor: Colors.white }}
  resizeMode="contain"
/>

// After
<Image 
  source={Images.ICON_ANIMATION_1}
  style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }}
  resizeMode="contain"
/>
```

### **2. Updated Driver Marker Styling**
```typescript
// Before
driverMarker: {
  backgroundColor: Colors.primary,
  borderRadius: 20,
  padding: 10,
  borderWidth: 3,
  borderColor: Colors.white,
  shadowColor: Colors.shadow,
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.25,
  shadowRadius: 4,
  elevation: 5,
}

// After
driverMarker: {
  // Remove background styling since iconAnimation1.png has its own glow effect
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  // Add a subtle shadow for better visibility on map
  shadowColor: Colors.shadow,
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.3,
  shadowRadius: 6,
  elevation: 8,
}
```

### **3. Added Logging**
```typescript
// Log when custom motorcycle icon is being used
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🏍️ Using custom motorcycle icon (iconAnimation1.png) for driver marker');
  console.log('🏍️ Icon source:', Images.ICON_ANIMATION_1);
  console.log('🏍️ Icon description: Top-down view of person riding motorcycle with green glow effect');
}, []);
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of the Custom Icon**

1. **Better Visual Representation**: The top-down motorcycle view clearly shows it's a bike/scooter ride
2. **Built-in Glow Effect**: The green glow makes the driver marker more visible on the map
3. **Professional Appearance**: Custom designed icon that matches the app's branding
4. **No Tinting Needed**: The icon has its own color scheme, so no white tinting is required
5. **Larger Size**: Increased from 32x32 to 40x40 for better visibility

## 📱 **Visual Impact**

- **Driver Marker**: Now shows a realistic top-down motorcycle with rider
- **Green Glow**: Creates a dynamic, active appearance suggesting movement
- **Better Contrast**: Stands out clearly against the map background
- **Professional Look**: Matches modern ride-sharing app standards

## 🔍 **Console Logs**

When the screen loads, you'll see:
```
🏍️ Using custom motorcycle icon (iconAnimation1.png) for driver marker
🏍️ Icon source: [Image source path]
🏍️ Icon description: Top-down view of person riding motorcycle with green glow effect
```

## 🎨 **Icon Specifications**

- **File**: `assets/images/iconAnimation1.png`
- **Style**: Top-down perspective, flat design
- **Colors**: Lime green motorcycle/rider, dark grey background
- **Effect**: Green glow around the motorcycle
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels in the app
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support

## ✅ **Testing**

The custom motorcycle icon will be visible:
- ✅ When driver location is available
- ✅ During real-time location updates
- ✅ With smooth animations and rotations
- ✅ On both light and dark map themes
- ✅ With proper shadow effects for visibility

The icon perfectly represents a motorcycle ride and provides a clear, professional visual indicator for the driver's location on the map!
